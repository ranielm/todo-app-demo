# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a simple Todo App Demo repository designed for demonstrating Claude Code capabilities. It consists of a basic web application with three empty starter files.

## Architecture

The project follows a simple client-side web application structure:
- `src/index.html` - Main HTML file for the todo app interface
- `src/app.js` - JavaScript logic for todo functionality  
- `src/style.css` - Styling for the application

## Development

This is a vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript project with no build tools or dependencies. To run the application:
1. Open `src/index.html` directly in a web browser
2. No build or compilation steps required

## Current State

All source files are currently empty placeholders, ready for implementation during live coding demonstrations.
