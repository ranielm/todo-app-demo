# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a vanilla JavaScript todo application demo repository. It contains minimal scaffolding with empty source files intended for live coding demonstrations.

## Development Setup

This is a static web application with no build process or dependencies:
- Open `src/index.html` directly in a web browser to run the application
- No installation or build commands required
- No package manager or dependencies

## Architecture

The application follows a simple structure:
- `src/index.html` - Main entry point and DOM structure
- `src/app.js` - JavaScript application logic
- `src/style.css` - Styling for the application

Since this is a vanilla JavaScript project, there are no frameworks, bundlers, or transpilation steps involved.

## Testing

No test framework is configured. Manual testing in the browser is the expected approach.

## Development Notes

This repository is specifically designed for demonstrating Claude Code capabilities through live coding. The empty source files are intentional, providing a clean slate for building a todo application from scratch.
